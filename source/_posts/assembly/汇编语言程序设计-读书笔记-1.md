**概述:**
+ 使用处理器指令代码进行程序设计.
+ 不同的汇编器使用不同的语法编写.

### 处理器指令
二进制代码:
+ 制造厂商预置在处理器内部.
+ 处理器使用它来操作数据.

#### 指令码处理
each instruction code set can contain one or more bytes of information thast instruct the processor to perform a specific task.
**Instruction Pointer** is used to help the processor keep track of which instruction codes have already been processed and what code is next in line to be processed.
**Data Pointer** is used to help the processor keep track of where the data area in memory starts.
This area is called the stack. As new data elements are placed in the stack, the pointer moves “down” in memory. As data is read from the stack, the pointer moves “up” in memory.
